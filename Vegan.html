    Plant-based foods are non-toxic. Vegetable foods are mainly plant flowers, stems, leaves, fruits, fruits, seeds, etc., </p>
    <p>which absorb the essence of sunlight, air, water, and soil to grow.</p>
    <p>When the body takes in these foods provided by nature, the blood can</p>
    <p>remain alkaline and improve the body's immunity. In addition, vegetable </p>
    <p>and fruit ingredients are rich in fiber and give you a sense of satiety. </p>
    <p>They are also easy to digest, metabolize quickly, and have less burden on the body.</p>
